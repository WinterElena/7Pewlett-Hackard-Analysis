# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis

### Purpose of Analysis
HR is tasked with looking at their current workforce and preparing for the future; what vacancies might arise due to upcoming retirements.  Additionally, what cost is incurred by the company as a result of these retirements.  HR needs to look at how many employees and who, specifically, is going to be eligible for retirement-- so they can plan ahead, for succession planning and cost of retirement packages.  


# Results?
- The spreadsheet called 'retirement_titles' provides us with a massive amount of data to review and is accurate, if we're looking for a list of who is going to be eligible to retire and the details of the employee such as: employee number, department, and title.
- However, adding one small adjustment to the statement allows for us modify the data and remove duplicates and make for a much more efficient and managable data set for us to review!  We can export this new table into it's own spreadsheet 'unique_titles', and present to our stakeholders.
- As we attempt to determine where we need to focus our efforts, having the ability to manipulate the data and group it according to job title is essential.  The table we created in the spreadsheet called 'retiring_titles' helps illustrate which groups will have the larger numbers of retiring members and will need the most attention as we develop a mentoring new talent in program.
- Lastly, WHO is currently on staff that can help us be prepared for this upcoming 'brain drain'?  Who is soon to retire but can be tapped to help us train their successor?  That data is captured in our 'mentorship_eligibility' spreadsheet, and has the names we need to present- so our stakeholders can keep them engaged and onboard!  


## Summary of Pewlett-Hackard Analysis:  
As Pewlett-Hackard reviews this data and considers the upcoming 'silver tsunami' it will be facing, it will need to make some extreme decisions to continue to maintain it's level of work without service interruptions.  They're looking at a phenomenal 300,026 individuals who are eligible to retire; with only 1,551 individuals who are qualified to mentor the next generation of employees.  And that was a very raw cut of the data, there are myriad other factors to consider: which departments / job titles are those 1551 in?  Do they align with the most dire need where the 300,026 are vacating?  Will all or even most of the 300,026 vacate in the timeframe we expect them to?  This was but a beginning of the data analysis, that can now begin in earnest.
